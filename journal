wrote revised project outline
setup project and git. linked with github
created prototype for GUI on Figma
produced functional requirement document and documented prototype
settled on tkinter as the gui library: best documentation and most proven, has all widgets necessary for prototype
tested tkinter capabilities by creating simple program with buttons

28/02
complete ethics form
review and submit revised project outline
begin implementing prototype model screen and review PCA Wavelet code
figured out how to dynamically resize all components with window resize
saved PCA Wavelet codebase to project
converted all into tkinter.ttk rather than tkinter for updated looks
began work on navigation between screens

07/03
finished construction of model screen
finished construction of training screen
finished construction of process screen
polished GUI code to make it more readable and maintainable
begin linking PCA Wavelet behaviour into GUI:
    created Model class to hold all model related information
    save and load buttons now open system dialogs
    input widgets now take inputs and store them, ready to be used with model
    set to default button functional

continued working on incorporating training:
    # train a model using 1DBuild model
update gui:
    changed button frames and layouts of windows to be consistent across program
    cleaned up old code
    added done button to process screen
    add abort dialog to process screen
hooked up model to gui:
    info frame displays model information now
    save button is activated when model information is stored
navigation:
    redid navigation to be much faster
