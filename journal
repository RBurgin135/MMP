21/02
wrote revised project outline
setup project and git. linked with github
created prototype for GUI on Figma
produced functional requirement document and documented prototype
settled on tkinter as the gui library: best documentation and most proven, has all widgets necessary for prototype
tested tkinter capabilities by creating simple program with buttons

28/02
complete ethics form
review and submit revised project outline
begin implementing prototype model screen and review PCA Wavelet code
figured out how to dynamically resize all components with window resize
saved PCA Wavelet codebase to project
converted all into tkinter.ttk rather than tkinter for updated looks
began work on navigation between screens

07/03
finished construction of model screen
finished construction of training screen
finished construction of process screen
polished GUI code to make it more readable and maintainable
begin linking PCA Wavelet behaviour into GUI:
    created Model class to hold all model related information
    save and load buttons now open system dialogs
    input widgets now take inputs and store them, ready to be used with model
    set to default button functional

14/03
continued working on incorporating training:
    added loading images to make a TF dataset
    investigated how to build a model using 1DBuild model
update gui:
    changed button frames and layouts of windows to be consistent across program
    cleaned up old code
    added done button to process screen
    add abort dialog to process screen
hooked up model to gui:
    info frame displays model information now
    save button is activated when model information is stored
navigation:
    redid navigation to be much faster

21/03
continue working on incorporating training:
    create a custom dataset using Tensorflow.dataset.Dataset
    build a model using 1DBuild method
add styling:
    text to have font size to reflect purpose
    background colour for shaded font and buttons
    make process screen title reflect the action
    # make info frame consistent width
add quality of life features:
    min size of window
add ability to apply model:
    change apply screen to notebook, and add tabs
    add model to apply to folder of images and output prediction
    add model to apply to one image and show result:
        add preview
        make it work
        add result screen
add load and saving functionality:
    add functionality
    multithread
    add loading and saving splash screens
add robustness error checking for inputs
    # for training screen
    for model save and load
    # for apply to directory
    # for apply to image
add functionality:
    # make process screen output to console
    abort terminates process
add comments and documentation:
    # screens
    # components
    # model
    # pca wavelet
