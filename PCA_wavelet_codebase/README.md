Code related to the paper:

Bernard Tiddeman and Morteza Ghahremani, "Principal Component Wavelet Networks for Solving Linear Inverse Problems", Symmetry, 2021.

Much of the ADMM code is taken from the original OneNet paper:

Rick Chang, J.; Li, C.L.; Poczos, B.; Vijaya Kumar, B.; Sankaranarayanan, A.C.,
"One Network to Solve Them All – Solving Linear Inverse Problems Using Deep Projection Models",
Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision, 2017, pp. 5888–5897.

Many thanks to the original authors and apologies for the abuse their code has recieved!
